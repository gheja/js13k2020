# js13k2020

A Travis-CI build to check if 
[everything is in the repository](https://github.com/gheja/js13k2020/commit/5a65ef9fa62370fe599caab19255ba6f6fb0c379)
and fits in 13 kilobytes:

A [js13kgames 2020](https://js13kgames.com/) entry, called
[Raccoon Transport 404](https://js13kgames.com/entries/raccoon-transport-404)

The entry had two kind of serious bugs when submitting: one affecting the
pathfinding (going offroad and on almost the worst routes), the other is
the display of the vehicles movements (choppy 45 degrees of moving). As I
was pretty exhausted and could not fix it before the deadline I blamed it
on the raccoons. Since then I've submitted a fix and it got into the
entry.

I had actually a lot of space left of the 13 KiB (13312 bytes) limit, I
didn't care to remove debug stuffs (see your console) and optimize it
seriously, it could fit a lot more, like additional models, maybe even
some music.

I might make an after the compo version, but I suspect due to lack of
free time and the push of a deadline it will stay in this form, as usual.
